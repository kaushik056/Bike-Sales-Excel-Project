# Customer Purchase Behavior Analysis

This repository contains an Excel portfolio focused on analyzing customer data to uncover trends and factors influencing bike purchases. Key components of the project include:

- **Data Cleaning and Transformation**: The raw dataset underwent extensive cleaning and manipulation to ensure accuracy and consistency. This process involved:
  - **Handling Missing Values**: Identified and addressed missing or inconsistent entries to maintain data integrity.
  - **Standardizing Formats**: Ensured uniformity in data formats, particularly for income and categorical fields.
  - **Creating New Columns**: An "Age Brackets" column was added to categorize customers into defined age groups (e.g., Adolescent, Middle Age, Old), facilitating more meaningful analysis.
  - **New Clean Data Sheet**: A separate sheet was created to house the cleaned data, making it easier for analysis and visualization.

- **Interactive Dashboard**: A user-friendly dashboard was developed to visualize essential metrics such as average income per purchase, customer age brackets, and commute distances. The dashboard includes filters for marital status, education, and region, allowing for dynamic data exploration.

- **Pivot Table Analysis**: Pivot tables were utilized to summarize key insights, such as average incomes of purchasers versus non-purchasers and the distribution of bike purchases across different demographics.
